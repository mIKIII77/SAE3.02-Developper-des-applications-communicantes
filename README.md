# SAE3.02 - Developper des applications communicantes
Here is the repository of the "SAE3.02" project.

To launch this project on your machine you have two choices. The first one is to launch the virtual environment that I provide in this repository to have all the dependencies already installed. The second method is to install the depandencies for this project from a .txt file that I also provide in this repository.

Here are the packages that must be installed on your computer before using my repository programme.(The versions I propose are tested by me and the program works perfectly with)
- Python3.10 and higher
- pip (The pip version depends on your python version)
