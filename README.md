# SAE3.02 - Developper des applications communicantes
Here is the repository of the "SAE3.02" project.

To launch this project on your machine you have two choices. The first one is to launch the virtual environment that I provide in this repository to have all the dependencies already installed. The second method is to install the depandencies for this project from a .txt file that I also provide in this repository.

Here are the packages that must be installed on your computer before using my repository programme.(The versions I propose are tested by me and the program works perfectly with)
- Python3.10 and higher
- pip (The pip version depends on your python version) 

#First method
To launch the virtual environment you have to follow these steps:
- Download the repository
- Open the terminal in the repository folder
- Type the following command: "source venv/bin/activate" if you are on Linux/MacOS or "venv\Scripts\activate" if you are on Windows (without the quotes)

And that's it, you can now launch the programme !

#Second method
To install the dependencies from the .txt file you have to follow these steps:
- Download the repository
- Open the terminal in the repository folder
- Type the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt" (without the quotes)

And that's it, you can now launch the programme ! 

#Launch the programme
To launch the programme you have to follow these steps:
- Open the terminal in the repository folder
- Type the following command: "python3 SuperVisionApp.py" (without the quotes) if you are on Linux/MacOS or "python.exe SuperVisionApp.py" if you are on Windows
- The programme will launch and you can now use it ! (Sure don't forget to launch the server before using the same procedure as above)
